## Input/Output


### b\_input

Scans for input from keyboard or serial.

Assembly Registers:

	 IN:	Nothing
	OUT:	AL = 0 if no key pressed, otherwise ASCII code, other regs preserved
		All other registers preserved

Assembly Example:

	call [b_input]
	mov byte [KeyChar], al
	...
	KeyChar: db 0

C Example:

	char KeyChar;
	KeyChar = b_input();
	if (KeyChar == 'a')
	...


### b\_output

Output a number of characters via the standard output method.

Assembly Registers:

	 IN:	RSI = message location
		RCX = number of characters to output
	OUT:	All registers preserved

Assembly Example:

	mov rsi, Message
	mov rcx, 4
	call [b_output]					; Only output the word 'This'
	...
	Message: db 'This is a test', 0

C Example:

	b_output_chars("This is a test", 4);	// Output 'This'

	char Message[] = "Hello, world!";
	b_output_chars(Message, 5);				// Output 'Hello'


## Network


### b\_net\_tx

Transmit data via a network interface

Assembly Registers:

	 IN:	RSI = memory location of packet
		RCX = length of packet
		RDX = Interface ID
	OUT:	All registers preserved

Assembly Example:

	mov rsi, Packet
	mov rcx, 1500
	mod rdx, 0
	call [b_net_tx]
	...
	Packet:
	Packet_Dest: db 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF ; Broadcast
	Packet_Src: db 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00
	Packet_Type: dw 0xABBA
	Packet_Data: db 'This is a test', 0

The packet must contain a proper 14-byte header.


### b\_net\_rx

Receive data via a network interface

Assembly Registers:

	 IN:	RDI = memory location to store packet
		RDX = Interface ID
	OUT:	RCX = length of packet, 0 if nothing to receive

Assembly Example:

	mov rdi, Packet
	mov rdx, 0
	call [b_net_rx]
	...
	Packet: times 1518 db 0

Note: BareMetal does not keep a buffer of received packets. This means that the OS will overwrite the last packet as soon as a new one is received. Continuously polling the network by checking `os_net_rx` often, is possible, but this is not ideal. BareMetal allows for a network interrupt callback handler to be run whenever a packet is received. With a callback, a program will always be aware of when a packet is received.


## Storage

BareMetal uses 4096 byte sectors for all drive access. Drive sectors start at 0.


### b\_storage\_read

Read a number of sectors from a drive to memory

Assembly Registers:

	 IN:	RAX = Starting sector #
	 	RCX = Number of sectors to read
	 	RDX = Drive #
		RDI = Destination memory address
	OUT:	RCX = Number of sectors read
		All other registers preserved

Assembly Example:

	mov rax, 0			; Read sector 0
	mov rcx, 1			; Read one sector
	mov rdx, 0			; Read from drive 0
	mov rdi, buffer			; Read drive data to this memory address
	call [b_storage_read]


### b\_storage\_write

Write a number of sectors from memory to a drive

Assembly Registers:

	 IN:	RAX = Starting sector #
	 	RCX = Number of sectors to write
	 	RDX = Drive #
		RSI = Source memory address
	OUT:	RCX = Number of sectors written
		All other registers preserved

Assembly Example:

	mov rax, 0			; Write to sector 0
	mov rcx, 1			; Write one sector
	mov rdx, 0			; Write to drive 0
	mov rsi, buffer			; Write the contents from this memory address to the drive
	call [b_storage_write]


## Misc


### b\_config

View or modify configuration options

Assembly Registers:

	 IN:	RCX = Function
		RAX = Variable 1
		RDX = Variable 2
	OUT:	RAX = Result

Function numbers come in pairs (one for reading a parameter, and one for writing a parameter). `b_config` should be called with a function alias and not a direct function number.

Currently the following functions are supported:

 - 0: timecounter

   get the timecounter, the timecounter increments 8 times a second
 - 1: smp_get_id

   Get the local ID of the processor
 - 2: free_memory

   Return the amount of free memory in MiB
 - 3: networkcallback_get

   get the current networkcallback entrypoint
 - 4: networkcallback_set

   set the current networkcallback entrypoint
 - 5: clockcallback_get

   get the current clockcallback entrypoint
 - 6: clockcallback_set

   set the current clockcallback entrypoint
 - 30: mac

   get the current mac address (or 0 if ethernet is down)

 - 50: drive info

   Queries a drive and returns a 512-byte or 4096byte block of data from the device.
   
   Useful segments:
   	- 20-39    Serial number (20 ASCII characters)
	- 46-52    Firmware revision (8 ASCII characters)
	- 54-93    Model number (40 ASCII characters)
	- 200-207    Total Number of User Addressable Sectors
	- 234-235    Words per Logical Sector

every function that gets something sets RAX with the result

every function that sets something gets the value from RAX


### b\_system

Call miscellaneous system sub-functions

Assembly Registers:

	 IN:	RCX = Function
		RAX = Variable 1
		RDX = Variable 2
	OUT:	RAX = Result 1
		RDX = Result 2

Currently the following functions are supported:

1. smp_get_id
	- Returns the APIC ID of the CPU that ran this function
	- out rax: The ID
2. smp_lock
	- Attempt to lock a mutex, this is a simple spinlock
	- in rax: The address of the mutex (one word)
3. smp_unlock
	- Unlock a mutex
	- in rax: The address of the mutex (one word)
4. debug_dump_mem
	- os_debug_dump_mem
	- in rax: The start of the memory to dump
	- in rdx: Number of bytes to dump
5. debug_dump_rax
	- Dump rax in Hex
	- in rax: The Content that gets printed to memory
6. delay
	- Delay by X microseconds
	- in rax: number of microseconds
7. net_status
	- Get the current mac address (or 0 if ethernet is down)
	- Same as system_config 30 (mac)
	- out rax: The mac address
8. mem_get_free
	- Returns the number of 2 MiB pages that are available
	- out rax: Number of pages
9. smp_numcores
	- Returns the number of cores in this computer
	- out rax: The number of cores
10. smp_queuelen
	- Returns the number of items in the processing queue
	- out rax: Number of items in processing queue
